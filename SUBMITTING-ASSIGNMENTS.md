## Submitting Your Assignments

1. Launch the GitHub Desktop client on your computer.

2. Now launch a browser and visit [`https://github.com/code-warrior/web-design-at-queens-college--fall-2016`](https://github.com/code-warrior/web-design-at-queens-college--fall-2016)

3. Click the green button along the right that says, `Clone or download`.

4. From the drop down options, click `Open in Desktop`. This will launch the GitHub Desktop client on your machine.

5. Leaving the text box to the right of `Clone As:` alone, choose the option to `Where` you’d like to save the repository.

6. You’ll now have a folder titled `web-design-at-queens-college--fall-2016` in the location you chose.

7. Along the top row of the GitHub Desktop client, you should see a drop down box that says `master` . Click it and choose your name from the drop down options.

8. Open the `web-design-at-queens-college--fall-2016` folder on your computer.

9. Inside the folder with your name, create a new folder called `midterm`, then place all your midterm project files in the new `midterm` folder. Toggle back to the GitHub Desktop client.

10. Along the top of the GitHub Desktop client you’ll see two tabs: one that says `X Uncommited Changes` and `History`. (`X` represents the number of files in your `midterm` folder. Everyone’s `X` will be different.) Click on `X Uncommited Changes`.

11. Along the bottom of the window you’ll see a one-line text box that says `Summary` in light gray and a multi-line text box that says `Description`. Fill in only the `Summary` box. Say something to the effect of, “Midterm project submission.”

12. Click the button below the `Description` box that says, `commit to YOUR_NAME`, where `YOUR_NAME` is the branch titled after your name.

13. Click `Sync` in the upper right hand corner.
